        cols="44">Ivana Maria Furtado of Goa is a name that we will hear more in the future. She has joined a select band of Indian chess players such as Anand, Hari Krishna, Humpy and Harika who have won at least two World Chess Championships.
Ivana became the World Under-8 girls’ champion in Turkey in a calm manner, with no show of emotion. Born on March 16, 1999, Ivana is a child who does not realise the greatness of her achievement. She had won the same World title at Batuumi, Georgia, in 2006 for the first time at the age of seven. 
It would be no big surprise, if Ivana breaks the records for becoming the youngest master and Grandmaster.In this category, two other Indians played well too, but were over-shadowed by the euphoria surrounding Ivana’s triumph. P. Preethy of Pondicherry (8th) and Ivana’s conqueror in the fifth round, C. H. Megna of Kochi (10th), could be expected to win laurels for India in the future.
India will look forward to triumphs at various levels by Ivana and these two girls.
